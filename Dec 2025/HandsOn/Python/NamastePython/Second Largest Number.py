"""
Given a list of integers, write a function to find the second largest number in the list.
If the list has fewer than two unique numbers, return None.
You should avoid using Python’s built-in sorting functions (sorted() or .sort()).

Example 1:
Input:
nums = [10, 4, 7, 9, 12, 12]
Output:
10
Explanation:
The largest number is 12.
The second largest distinct number is 10.

Example 2:
Input:
nums = [5, 5, 5]
Output:
None
Explanation:
All elements are the same, so there’s no second largest unique number.

Example 3:
Input:
nums = [3, 1]
Output:
1
Explanation:
The numbers are [3, 1], and the second largest number is 1.

Constraints:
2 <= len(nums) <= 10^5
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
Your solution should ideally run in O(n) time complexity.
