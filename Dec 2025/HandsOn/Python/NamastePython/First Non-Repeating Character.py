"""
Given a string, find and return the first character that does not repeat anywhere in the string.
If all characters repeat or the string is empty, return None.
The comparison should be case-sensitive -
for example, 'A' and 'a' are considered different characters.
 

Example 1:
Input:
s = "swiss" 
Output:
'w' 
Explanation:
Frequency of characters:
s → 3, w → 1, i → 1
The first character that appears only once is 'w'.

Example 1:

Input:
s = "aabbcc" 
Output:
None 
Explanation:
All characters repeat, so there’s no non-repeating character.

Example 2:
Input:
s = "aAbBABac" 
Output:
'b' 
Explanation:
'a' and 'A' are different (case-sensitive).
Character frequencies: a → 2, A → 2, b → 1, B → 1, c → 1
The first non-repeating character is 'b'.

Constraints
0 <= len(s) <= 10^5
The string may contain lowercase and uppercase English letters.
